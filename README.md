# hand_eye_calibration
This repository presents a comprehensive solution to the hand-eye calibration problem, a fundamental challenge in robotics and computer vision. Hand-eye calibration is critical for applications requiring precise alignment between the coordinate system of a robotic manipulator (the 'hand') and a vision system (the 'eye').
